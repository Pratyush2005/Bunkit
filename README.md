# Attcal

**Attcal** is a simple attendance calculator that helps you keep track of how many hours you can afford to miss and how much attendance is required to maintain a minimum of 75%. It's built using React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Features
- Completely manual (doesn't use any api's) so you can use it when "SRM-CHECK" or "AcademiaPro" is down.
- Calculate the number of hours you can miss while keeping attendance above 75%.
- Determine how much attendance is required if it's below 75%.
- Mobile-friendly and optimized for various screen sizes.
- Minimalistic interface.
